## Shelter Sight User Interface
### Background
As part of the process of creating the model, we have also built a prototype that uses the data that have collected from the city of Toronto and the models that we have built. The idea of the UI serves as a "final product" to our project and also as a proof-of-concept that our data and model is indeed applicable for practical applications.

### Video Demonstration
The video below provides a demonstration to how the software functions. We will also go over all the functionalities in this readme as well, but this video serves as an alternative way of understanding how ShelterSight works.
