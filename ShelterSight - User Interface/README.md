## Shelter Sight User Interface
### Background
In our journey to create a reliable model, we've dedicated ourselves to crafting a prototype that leverages data collected from the city of Toronto, paired with our models. This user interface (UI) prototype isn't just the final output of our project; it also serves as an illustration of how our data and models can be put into practical use.

This UI prototype represents the culmination of countless hours of research, development, and fine-tuning. It's a tangible manifestation of our commitment to delivering impactful solutions.

### Video Demonstration
The video below provides a demonstration to how the software functions. We will also go over all the functionalities in this readme as well, but this video serves as an alternative way of understanding how ShelterSight works.
