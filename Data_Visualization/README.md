# Data Visualization
## Overview
This repository contains several data visualization files that serve as essential tools for exploring and understanding the underlying trends and patterns within our dataset. Each visualization is crafted to provide insights into different aspects of shelter usage, such as occupancy rates, demographic distributions, and seasonal variations. Visualizations simplify complex data, making it easier to identify and communicate key findings and trends, and help highlight correlations and anomalies that might not be apparent from raw data alone.

## Data Sets
* Daily Shelter Occupancy: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/
* Weather: https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html
* Available low-cost housing: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/324befd1-893b-42e6-bece-6d30af3dd9f1
* Persons in Crisis Calls: https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/79c8e950bfe54ce39334ba108e1b325f_0/explore

## Understanding Trends
In the data_trends.ipynb notebook, we use data visualizations to uncover and understand the underlying patterns and trends. Each visualization serves as a window into the data, highlighting essential trends over the past few years. The image below shows examples of these charts.

## Understanding Relationships and Correlations
In the data_correlation.ipynb notebook, we try to uncover relationships between data features and correlations in capacity between different shelters. The image below shows examples of the heatmaps used for this data visualization.
