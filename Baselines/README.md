# Baseline Models

In this section, we outline the baseline models we used to evaluate the performance of our proposed model. These baselines were carefully selected to ensure a robust evaluation of our proposed methodology. We will describe the process behind each baseline model, detail their implementation, and outline the results. We will also show a comparative analysis of the performance of all the baseline models. This comprehensive benchmarking provides a clear context for assessing the strengths and potential improvements of our proposed solution.
